+If this is your first time building the HTML5 parser, you need to execute the
+following commands (from this directory) to bootstrap the translation:
+
+  make sync      # fetch remote source files and licenses
+  make           # build javaparser.jar and translator.jar
+  make translate # perform the Java-to-C++ translation
+
+If you make changes to the translator or the javaparser, you can rebuild by
+retyping 'make' in this directory.  If you make changes to the HTML5 java
+implementation, you can retranslate the java sources by retyping 'make
+translate' in this directory.
